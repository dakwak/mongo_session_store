# MongoSessionStore

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mongoid/mongo_session_store.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mongoid/mongo_session_store) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/mongo_session_store.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/mongo_session_store)

## Description

MongoSessionStore is a Rails-compatible session store for Mongo using either
Mongoid or the Ruby MongoDB driver. It also allows for custom Mongo session
store that works with any (or no!) Mongo ODM.

## Usage

MongoSessionStore is compatible with Rails 4.0 through 4.2.

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "mongoid"
# or gem "mongo"
gem "mongo_session_store"
```

In the session_store initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/session_store.rb

# Mongoid
MyApp::Application.config.session_store :mongoid_store

# anything else
MongoStore::Session.database = Mongo::Client.new(["127.0.0.1:27017"], database: "my_app_development")
MyApp::Application.config.session_store :mongo_store
```

By default, the sessions will be stored in the "sessions" collection in
MongoDB. If you want to use a different collection, you can set that in the
initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/session_store.rb
MongoSessionStore.collection_name = "client_sessions"
```

And if you want to query your sessions:

```ruby
# Mongoid
MongoidStore::Session.where(:updated_at.gt => 2.days.ago)

# Plain old Mongo
MongoStore::Session.where('updated_at' => { '$gt' => 2.days.ago })
```

## Changelog

7.0.0 Drops explicit MongoMapper support, but can be readded manually with a
custom session class. Drops explicit JRuby support. Moved session data packing
and unpacking to the session models themselves. Adds more tests to internals.

6.0.0 supports the Mongo Ruby Driver 2.0 for the generic MongoStore. The other
stores are unchanged. Tests added for Rails 4.2. Tests against MongoDB 3.0.1 on
Travis CI.

5.1.0 generates a new session ID when a session is not found. Previously, when
a session ID is provided in the request but the session was not found (because
for example, it was removed from Mongo by a sweeper job) a new session with the
provided ID would be created. This would cause a write error if two
simultaneous requests both create a session with the same ID and both try to
insert a new document with that ID.

5.0.1 suppresses a warning from Mongoid 4 when setting the _id field type to
String.

5.0.0 introduces Rails 4.0 and 4.1 support and Mongoid 4 support alongside the
existing Rails 3.1, 3.2, and Mongoid 3 support. Ruby 1.8.7 support is dropped.
The database is no longer set automatically for the MongoStore when MongoMapper
or Mongoid is present. You have to set the database manually whenever you
choose to use the vanilla MongoStore.

The last version to support Ruby 1.8.7 is [version
4.1.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/mongo_session_store-rails3/versions/4.1.1).

The last version to support Rails 3.0 or Mongoid 2 is [version
3.0.6](https://rubygems.org/gems/mongo_session_store-rails3/versions/3.0.6).

## Development

To run all the tests:

```sh
rake
```

To run the tests for a specific store:

```sh
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails-4.0-mongo.gemfile bundle exec rake
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails-4.0-mongoid.gemfile bundle exec rake
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails-4.1-mongo.gemfile bundle exec rake
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails-4.1-mongoid.gemfile bundle exec rake
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails-4.2-mongo.gemfile bundle exec rake
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/rails-4.2-mongoid.gemfile bundle exec rake
```

## Performance benchmark

The repository includes a performance benchmark. It runrs against all available
included stores and outputs the results.

```
ruby perf/benchmark.rb
```

## Releases

To create a new release checkou the `master` branch and make sure it's in the
right state to release. Run the `release` Rake task and follow the
instructions.

```
rake release
```
